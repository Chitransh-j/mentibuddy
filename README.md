Mentibuddy
According to Coursera, an online learning platform that partners with over 275 universities in India and abroad, there was a 230% increase in enrollment in psychology courses in India from 2018 to 2022. However, despite this surge in interest, there remains a significant lack of professional coaches and tools to support them.

Mentibuddy aims to bridge this gap by providing mental coaches with a robust tool to manage their clients. With this application, coaches can maintain detailed records, monitor progress, and ensure that every client receives the best possible care.

Mentibuddy is a powerful CRUD-based application designed to assist mental coaches in managing their clients effectively. This user-friendly tool provides a comprehensive dashboard that helps coaches keep track of their clients' conditions, sessions, and progress in an organized and efficient manner.
